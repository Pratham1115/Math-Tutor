# MathMentor AI

## Project Overview

Traditional math learning tools provide static content that does not adapt to individual student performance. MathMentor AI addresses this challenge by creating a **personalized, adaptive, and reflective learning experience**.  

Our AI system monitors student performance, analyzes response patterns, and adjusts difficulty in real-time while providing personalized hints and feedback.

## System Architecture

MathMentor AI implements a **continuous feedback loop** between student performance and content delivery:

1. **Student Input:**  
   - Students submit answers and interact with the system.  
   - Interaction data is recorded, including hints requested.  

2. **Performance Tracking:**  
   - Response time and accuracy are monitored for each question.  

3. **ML Analysis:**  
   - A machine learning model predicts the optimal difficulty level for the next question.  
   - The system identifies concept gaps based on response patterns and accuracy.  

4. **Smart Feedback:**  
   - Personalized hints and guidance are provided depending on student performance.  

5. **Progress Display:**  
   - Students receive visual insights into their learning progress and improvement areas.

## ML Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Inputs: response time, accuracy percentage, hints requested, current difficulty, and interaction patterns  

2. **ML Processing:**  
   - Models (Decision Tree / Logistic Regression) predict:  
     - Optimal student challenge level  
     - Concept gaps requiring attention  

3. **Adaptive Output:**  
   - Next question difficulty is calibrated to the student's learning zone  
   - Personalized hints and guidance are generated based on ML analysis
